(3/1198)  The kettle began it! Don't tell me what Mrs. Peerybingle said. I know better. Mrs. Peerybingle may leave it on record to the end of time that she couldn't say which of them began it; but, I say the kettle did. I ought... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(4/1198) ...to know, I hope! The kettle began it, full five minutes by the little waxy-faced Dutch clock in the corner, before the Cricket uttered a chirp. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(7/1198)  Why, I am not naturally positive. Every one knows that. I wouldn't set my own opinion against the opinion of Mrs. Peerybingle, unless I were quite sure, on any account whatever. Nothing should induce me. But, this is a... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(8/1198) ...question of fact. And the fact is, that the kettle began it, at least five minutes before the Cricket gave any sign of being in existence. Contradict me, and I'll say ten. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(9/1198)  Let me narrate exactly how it happened. I should have proceeded to do so in my very first word, but for this plain consideration-if I am to tell a story I must begin at the beginning; and how is it possible to begin at... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(10/1198) ...the beginning, without beginning at the kettle? #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(11/1198) It appeared as if there were a sort of match, or trial of skill, you must understand, between the kettle and the Cricket.  And this is what led to it, and how it came about. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(18/1198) ...and dribble, a very Idiot of a kettle, on the hearth. It was quarrelsome, and hissed and spluttered morosely at the fire. To sum up all, the lid, resisting Mrs. Peerybingle's fingers, first of all turned topsy-turvy,... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(19/1198) ...and then, with an ingenious pertinacity deserving of a better cause, dived sideways in-down to the very bottom of the kettle. And the hull of the Royal George has never made half the monstrous resistance to coming out... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(21/1198) It looked sullen and pig-headed enough, even then; carrying its handle with an air of defiance, and cocking its spout pertly and mockingly at Mrs. Peerybingle, as if it said, 'I won't boil.  Nothing shall induce me!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(22/1198)  But Mrs. Peerybingle, with restored good humour, dusted her chubby little hands against each other, and sat down before the kettle, laughing. Meantime, the jolly blaze uprose and fell, flashing and gleaming on the... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(57/1198)  This end attained, the kettle, being dead beat, boiled over, and was taken off the fire. Mrs. Peerybingle then went running to the door, where, what with the wheels of a cart, the tramp of a horse, the voice of a man,... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(65/1198) 'I wish you wouldn't call me Dot, John.  I don't like it,' said Mrs. Peerybingle: pouting in a way that clearly showed she did like it, very much. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(66/1198)  'Why what else are you?' returned John, looking down upon her with a smile, and giving her waist as light a squeeze as his huge hand and arm could give. 'A dot and'-here he glanced at the baby-'a dot and carry-I won't... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(82/1198) 'It an't right for him to turn 'em up in that way!' said the astonished Carrier, 'is it?  See how he's winking with both of 'em at once!  And look at his mouth!  Why he's gasping like a gold and silver fish!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(114/1198) 'The first time I heard its cheerful little note, John, was on that night when you brought me home-when you brought me to my new home here; its little mistress.  Nearly a year ago.  You recollect, John?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(143/1198) John nodded. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(177/1198) 'Sitting in the open air, John!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(178/1198) 'In the open air,' replied the Carrier, 'just at dusk.  “Carriage Paid,” he said; and gave me eighteenpence.  Then he got in.  And there he is.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(179/1198) 'He's going, John, I think!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(180/1198) Not at all.  He was only going to speak. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(181/1198) 'If you please, I was to be left till called for,' said the Stranger, mildly.  'Don't mind me.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(182/1198) With that, he took a pair of spectacles from one of his large pockets, and a book from another, and leisurely began to read.  Making no more of Boxer than if he had been a house lamb! #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(183/1198) The Carrier and his wife exchanged a look of perplexity.  The Stranger raised his head; and glancing from the latter to the former, said, #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(184/1198) 'Your daughter, my good friend?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(188/1198) 'Indeed?' observed the Stranger.  'Surely?  Very young!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(189/1198) He quietly turned over, and resumed his reading.  But, before he could have read two lines, he again interrupted himself to say: #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(190/1198) 'Baby, yours?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(191/1198) John gave him a gigantic nod; equivalent to an answer in the affirmative, delivered through a speaking trumpet. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(192/1198) 'Girl?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(193/1198) 'Bo-o-oy!' roared John. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(195/1198)  Mrs. Peerybingle instantly struck in. 'Two months and three da-ays! Vaccinated just six weeks ago-o! Took very fine-ly! Considered, by the doctor, a remarkably beautiful chi-ild! Equal to the general run of children at... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(211/1198)  'Why, pretty well, John,' he returned, with the distraught air of a man who was casting about for the Philosopher's stone, at least. 'Pretty much so. There's rather a run on Noah's Arks at present. I could have wished... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(215/1198) 'There it is!' he said, adjusting it with great care.  'Not so much as a leaf damaged.  Full of buds!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(217/1198) 'Dear, Caleb,' said the Carrier.  'Very dear at this season.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(218/1198) 'Never mind that.  It would be cheap to me, whatever it cost,' returned the little man.  'Anything else, John?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(219/1198) 'A small box,' replied the Carrier.  'Here you are!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(222/1198)  'Oh! To be sure!' said Caleb. 'It's all right. With care! Yes, yes; that's mine. It might have been with cash, indeed, if my dear Boy in the Golden South Americas had lived, John. You loved him like a son; didn't you?... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(223/1198) ...You needn't say you did. I know, of course. “Caleb Plummer. With care.” Yes, yes, it's all right. It's a box of dolls' eyes for my daughter's work. I wish it was her own sight in a box, John.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(224/1198) 'I wish it was, or could be!' cried the Carrier. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(229/1198) 'Something for our Governor, eh?' said Caleb, after pondering a little while.  'To be sure.  That's what I came for; but my head's so running on them Arks and things!  He hasn't been here, has he?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(230/1198) 'Not he,' returned the Carrier.  'He's too busy, courting.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(231/1198)  'He's coming round though,' said Caleb; 'for he told me to keep on the near side of the road going home, and it was ten to one he'd take me up. I had better go, by the bye.-You couldn't have the goodness to let me pinch... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(266/1198) 'I say!  A word with you,' murmured Tackleton, nudging the Carrier with his elbow, and taking him a little apart.  'You'll come to the wedding?  We're in the same boat, you know.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(267/1198) 'How in the same boat?' inquired the Carrier. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(285/1198) 'Don't!' cried Tackleton, with a short, sharp laugh.  'Don't what?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(286/1198)  The Carrier had some faint idea of adding, 'dote upon you.' But, happening to meet the half-closed eye, as it twinkled upon him over the turned-up collar of the cape, which was within an ace of poking it out, he felt it... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(290/1198)  'I have the humour,' said Tackleton: holding up the fingers of his left hand, and tapping the forefinger, to imply 'there I am, Tackleton to wit:' 'I have the humour, sir, to marry a young wife, and a pretty wife:' here... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(294/1198) 'She honours and obeys, no doubt, you know,' said Tackleton; 'and that, as I am not a man of sentiment, is quite enough for me.  But do you think there's anything more in it?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(295/1198) 'I think,' observed the Carrier, 'that I should chuck any man out of window, who said there wasn't.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(296/1198) 'Exactly so,' returned the other with an unusual alacrity of assent.  'To be sure!  Doubtless you would.  Of course.  I'm certain of it.  Good night.  Pleasant dreams!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(297/1198) The Carrier was puzzled, and made uncomfortable and uncertain, in spite of himself.  He couldn't help showing it, in his manner. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(298/1198)  'Good night, my dear friend!' said Tackleton, compassionately. 'I'm off. We're exactly alike, in reality, I see. You won't give us to-morrow evening? Well! Next day you go out visiting, I know. I'll meet you there, and... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(299/1198) ...bring my wife that is to be. It'll do her good. You're agreeable? Thank'ee. What's that!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(300/1198)  It was a loud cry from the Carrier's wife: a loud, sharp, sudden cry, that made the room ring, like a glass vessel. She had risen from her seat, and stood like one transfixed by terror and surprise. The Stranger had... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(301/1198) ...advanced towards the fire to warm himself, and stood within a short stride of her chair. But quite still. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(302/1198) 'Dot!' cried the Carrier.  'Mary!  Darling!  What's the matter?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(303/1198)  They were all about her in a moment. Caleb, who had been dozing on the cake-box, in the first imperfect recovery of his suspended presence of mind, seized Miss Slowboy by the hair of her head, but immediately... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(304/1198) ...apologised. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(305/1198) 'Mary!' exclaimed the Carrier, supporting her in his arms.  'Are you ill!  What is it?  Tell me, dear!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(306/1198)  She only answered by beating her hands together, and falling into a wild fit of laughter. Then, sinking from his grasp upon the ground, she covered her face with her apron, and wept bitterly. And then she laughed again,... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(307/1198) ...and then she cried again, and then she said how cold it was, and suffered him to lead her to the fire, where she sat down as before. The old man standing, as before, quite still. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(308/1198) 'I'm better, John,' she said.  'I'm quite well now-I-' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(309/1198) 'John!'  But John was on the other side of her.  Why turn her face towards the strange old gentleman, as if addressing him!  Was her brain wandering? #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(310/1198) 'Only a fancy, John dear-a kind of shock-a something coming suddenly before my eyes-I don't know what it was.  It's quite gone, quite gone.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(311/1198) 'I'm glad it's gone,' muttered Tackleton, turning the expressive eye all round the room.  'I wonder where it's gone, and what it was.  Humph!  Caleb, come here!  Who's that with the grey hair?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(312/1198) 'I don't know, sir,' returned Caleb in a whisper.  'Never see him before, in all my life.  A beautiful figure for a nut-cracker; quite a new model.  With a screw-jaw opening down into his waistcoat, he'd be lovely.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(313/1198) 'Not ugly enough,' said Tackleton. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(314/1198)  'Or for a firebox, either,' observed Caleb, in deep contemplation, 'what a model! Unscrew his head to put the matches in; turn him heels up'ards for the light; and what a firebox for a gentleman's mantel-shelf, just as... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(315/1198) ...he stands!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(316/1198) 'Not half ugly enough,' said Tackleton.  'Nothing in him at all!  Come!  Bring that box!  All right now, I hope?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(317/1198) 'Oh quite gone! Quite gone!!' said the little woman, waving him hurriedly away.  'Good night!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(318/1198) 'Good night,' said Tackleton.  'Good night, John Peerybingle!  Take care how you carry that box, Caleb.  Let it fall, and I'll murder you!  Dark as pitch, and weather worse than ever, eh?  Good night!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(319/1198) So, with another sharp look round the room, he went out at the door; followed by Caleb with the wedding-cake on his head. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(320/1198)  The Carrier had been so much astounded by his little wife, and so busily engaged in soothing and tending her, that he had scarcely been conscious of the Stranger's presence, until now, when he again stood there, their... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(321/1198) ...only guest. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(322/1198) 'He don't belong to them, you see,' said John.  'I must give him a hint to go.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(323/1198)  'I beg your pardon, friend,' said the old gentleman, advancing to him; 'the more so, as I fear your wife has not been well; but the Attendant whom my infirmity,' he touched his ears and shook his head, 'renders almost... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(326/1198) 'Yes, yes,' cried Dot.  'Yes!  Certainly!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(327/1198) 'Oh!' said the Carrier, surprised by the rapidity of this consent. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(328/1198) 'Well!  I don't object; but, still I'm not quite sure that-' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(329/1198) 'Hush!' she interrupted.  'Dear John!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(330/1198) 'Why, he's stone deaf,' urged John. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(331/1198) 'I know he is, but-Yes, sir, certainly.  Yes! certainly!  I'll make him up a bed, directly, John.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(332/1198) As she hurried off to do it, the flutter of her spirits, and the agitation of her manner, were so strange that the Carrier stood looking after her, quite confounded. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(333/1198) 'Did its mothers make it up a Beds then!' cried Miss Slowboy to the Baby; 'and did its hair grow brown and curly, when its caps was lifted off, and frighten it, a precious Pets, a-sitting by the fires!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(334/1198)  With that unaccountable attraction of the mind to trifles, which is often incidental to a state of doubt and confusion, the Carrier as he walked slowly to and fro, found himself mentally repeating even these absurd... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(335/1198) ...words, many times. So many times that he got them by heart, and was still conning them over and over, like a lesson, when Tilly, after administering as much friction to the little bald head with her hand as she... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(337/1198) 'And frighten it, a precious Pets, a-sitting by the fires.  What frightened Dot, I wonder!' mused the Carrier, pacing to and fro. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(338/1198)  He scouted, from his heart, the insinuations of the Toy-merchant, and yet they filled him with a vague, indefinite uneasiness. For, Tackleton was quick and sly; and he had that painful sense, himself, of being a man of... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(341/1198)  The bed was soon made ready; and the visitor, declining all refreshment but a cup of tea, retired. Then, Dot-quite well again, she said, quite well again-arranged the great chair in the chimney-corner for her husband;... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(342/1198) ...filled his pipe and gave it him; and took her usual little stool beside him on the hearth. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(343/1198) She always would sit on that little stool.  I think she must have had a kind of notion that it was a coaxing, wheedling little stool. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(344/1198)  She was, out and out, the very best filler of a pipe, I should say, in the four quarters of the globe. To see her put that chubby little finger in the bowl, and then blow down the pipe to clear the tube, and, when she... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(438/1198) 'Well! and being there,-how are you?' said Tackleton, in his grudging way. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(439/1198) 'Oh! well; quite well.  And as happy as even you can wish me to be.  As happy as you would make the whole world, if you could!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(440/1198) 'Poor Idiot!' muttered Tackleton.  'No gleam of reason.  Not a gleam!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(445/1198) 'Red in the mornings and the evenings, Bertha,' said poor Caleb, with a woeful glance at his employer. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(455/1198) 'Shall I tell you a secret, Bertha?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(456/1198) 'If you will!' she answered, eagerly. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(458/1198)  'This is the day on which little what's-her-name, the spoilt child, Peerybingle's wife, pays her regular visit to you-makes her fantastic Pic-Nic here; an't it?' said Tackleton, with a strong expression of distaste for... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(461/1198) 'I thought so,' said Tackleton.  'I should like to join the party.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(462/1198) 'Do you hear that, father!' cried the Blind Girl in an ecstasy. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(463/1198) 'Yes, yes, I hear it,' murmured Caleb, with the fixed look of a sleep-walker; 'but I don't believe it.  It's one of my lies, I've no doubt.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(464/1198) 'You see I-I want to bring the Peerybingles a little more into company with May Fielding,' said Tackleton.  'I am going to be married to May.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(465/1198) 'Married!' cried the Blind Girl, starting from him. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(466/1198)  'She's such a con-founded Idiot,' muttered Tackleton, 'that I was afraid she'd never comprehend me. Ah, Bertha! Married! Church, parson, clerk, beadle, glass-coach, bells, breakfast, bride-cake, favours, marrow-bones,... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(468/1198) 'I know,' replied the Blind Girl, in a gentle tone.  'I understand!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(469/1198)  'Do you?' muttered Tackleton. 'It's more than I expected. Well! On that account I want to join the party, and to bring May and her mother. I'll send in a little something or other, before the afternoon. A cold leg of... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(471/1198) 'Yes,' she answered. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(472/1198) She had drooped her head, and turned away; and so stood, with her hands crossed, musing. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(473/1198) 'I don't think you will,' muttered Tackleton, looking at her; 'for you seem to have forgotten all about it, already.  Caleb!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(474/1198) 'I may venture to say I'm here, I suppose,' thought Caleb.  'Sir!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(475/1198) 'Take care she don't forget what I've been saying to her.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(476/1198) 'She never forgets,' returned Caleb.  'It's one of the few things she an't clever in.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(477/1198) 'Every man thinks his own geese swans,' observed the Toy-merchant, with a shrug.  'Poor devil!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(478/1198) Having delivered himself of which remark, with infinite contempt, old Gruff and Tackleton withdrew. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(479/1198)  Bertha remained where he had left her, lost in meditation. The gaiety had vanished from her downcast face, and it was very sad. Three or four times she shook her head, as if bewailing some remembrance or some loss; but... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(480/1198) ...her sorrowful reflections found no vent in words. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(485/1198) 'Look round the room, father.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(486/1198) 'All right,' said Caleb.  'No sooner said than done, Bertha.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(487/1198) 'Tell me about it.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(488/1198)  'It's much the same as usual,' said Caleb. 'Homely, but very snug. The gay colours on the walls; the bright flowers on the plates and dishes; the shining wood, where there are beams or panels; the general cheerfulness... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(489/1198) ...and neatness of the building; make it very pretty.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(490/1198) Cheerful and neat it was wherever Bertha's hands could busy themselves.  But nowhere else, were cheerfulness and neatness possible, in the old crazy shed which Caleb's fancy so transformed. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(491/1198) 'You have your working dress on, and are not so gallant as when you wear the handsome coat?' said Bertha, touching him. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(492/1198) 'Not quite so gallant,' answered Caleb.  'Pretty brisk though.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(493/1198) 'Father,' said the Blind Girl, drawing close to his side, and stealing one arm round his neck, 'tell me something about May.  She is very fair?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(494/1198) 'She is indeed,' said Caleb.  And she was indeed.  It was quite a rare thing to Caleb, not to have to draw on his invention. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(495/1198) 'Her hair is dark,' said Bertha, pensively, 'darker than mine.  Her voice is sweet and musical, I know.  I have often loved to hear it.  Her shape-' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(496/1198) 'There's not a Doll's in all the room to equal it,' said Caleb.  'And her eyes!-' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(497/1198) He stopped; for Bertha had drawn closer round his neck, and from the arm that clung about him, came a warning pressure which he understood too well. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(498/1198) He coughed a moment, hammered for a moment, and then fell back upon the song about the sparkling bowl; his infallible resource in all such difficulties. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(499/1198) 'Our friend, father, our benefactor.  I am never tired, you know, of hearing about him.-Now, was I ever?' she said, hastily. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(500/1198) 'Of course not,' answered Caleb, 'and with reason.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(501/1198)  'Ah! With how much reason!' cried the Blind Girl. With such fervency, that Caleb, though his motives were so pure, could not endure to meet her face; but dropped his eyes, as if she could have read in them his innocent... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(511/1198)  'I love her, father; I can love her from my soul!' exclaimed the Blind Girl. And saying so, she laid her poor blind face on Caleb's shoulder, and so wept and wept, that he was almost sorry to have brought that tearful... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(589/1198)  Her old friend was, to the full, as hearty and as glad as she; and it really was, if you'll believe me, quite a pleasant sight to see them embrace. Tackleton was a man of taste beyond all question. May was very pretty. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(606/1198) 'Why, you an't particularly old, at any time; are you?' said Tackleton. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(607/1198) 'Look at my sober plodding husband there,' returned Dot.  'He adds twenty years to my age at least.  Don't you, John?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(608/1198) 'Forty,' John replied. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(609/1198) 'How many you'll add to May's, I am sure I don't know,' said Dot, laughing.  'But she can't be much less than a hundred years of age on her next birthday.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(610/1198) 'Ha ha!' laughed Tackleton.  Hollow as a drum, that laugh though.  And he looked as if he could have twisted Dot's neck, comfortably. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(611/1198)  'Dear dear!' said Dot. 'Only to remember how we used to talk, at school, about the husbands we would choose. I don't know how young, and how handsome, and how gay, and how lively, mine was not to be! And as to May's!-Ah... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(613/1198) May seemed to know which to do; for the colour flushed into her face, and tears stood in her eyes. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(614/1198)  'Even the very persons themselves-real live young men-were fixed on sometimes,' said Dot. 'We little thought how things would come about. I never fixed on John I'm sure; I never so much as thought of him. And if I had... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(616/1198) Though May didn't say yes, she certainly didn't say no, or express no, by any means. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(617/1198) Tackleton laughed-quite shouted, he laughed so loud.  John Peerybingle laughed too, in his ordinary good-natured and contented manner; but his was a mere whisper of a laugh, to Tackleton's. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(618/1198) 'You couldn't help yourselves, for all that.  You couldn't resist us, you see,' said Tackleton.  'Here we are!  Here we are!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(662/1198) 'Oh father, father!' cried the Blind Girl, bursting into tears.  'Oh my hard, hard fate!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(675/1198) She knew he hesitated, and said, 'May.  Bring May!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(676/1198) May heard the mention of her name, and coming quietly towards her, touched her on the arm.  The Blind Girl turned immediately, and held her by both hands. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(733/1198)  His challenge was addressed to the old lady, who accepting it with gracious readiness, they were soon engaged upon the game. At first, the Carrier looked about him sometimes, with a smile, or now and then called Dot to... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(734/1198) ...peep over his shoulder at his hand, and advise him on some knotty point. But his adversary being a rigid disciplinarian, and subject to an occasional weakness in respect of pegging more than she was entitled to,... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(737/1198) 'I am sorry to disturb you-but a word, directly.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(738/1198) 'I'm going to deal,' returned the Carrier.  'It's a crisis.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(739/1198) 'It is,' said Tackleton.  'Come here, man!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(740/1198) There was that in his pale face which made the other rise immediately, and ask him, in a hurry, what the matter was. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(741/1198) 'Hush!  John Peerybingle,' said Tackleton.  'I am sorry for this.  I am indeed.  I have been afraid of it.  I have suspected it from the first.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(742/1198) 'What is it?' asked the Carrier, with a frightened aspect. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(743/1198) 'Hush!  I'll show you, if you'll come with me.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(744/1198)  The Carrier accompanied him, without another word. They went across a yard, where the stars were shining, and by a little side-door, into Tackleton's own counting-house, where there was a glass window, commanding the... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(745/1198) ...ware-room, which was closed for the night. There was no light in the counting-house itself, but there were lamps in the long narrow ware-room; and consequently the window was bright. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(746/1198) 'A moment!' said Tackleton.  'Can you bear to look through that window, do you think?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(747/1198) 'Why not?' returned the Carrier. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(748/1198) 'A moment more,' said Tackleton.  'Don't commit any violence.  It's of no use.  It's dangerous too.  You're a strong-made man; and you might do murder before you know it.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(749/1198) The Carrier looked him in the face, and recoiled a step as if he had been struck.  In one stride he was at the window, and he saw- #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(750/1198) Oh Shadow on the Hearth!  Oh truthful Cricket!  Oh perfidious Wife! #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(751/1198)  He saw her, with the old man-old no longer, but erect and gallant-bearing in his hand the false white hair that had won his way into their desolate and miserable home. He saw her listening to him, as he bent his head to... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(752/1198) ...whisper in her ear; and suffering him to clasp her round the waist, as they moved slowly down the dim wooden gallery towards the door by which they had entered it. He saw them stop, and saw her turn-to have the face,... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(753/1198) ...the face he loved so, so presented to his view!-and saw her, with her own hands, adjust the lie upon his head, laughing, as she did it, at his unsuspicious nature! #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(754/1198)  He clenched his strong right hand at first, as if it would have beaten down a lion. But opening it immediately again, he spread it out before the eyes of Tackleton (for he was tender of her, even then), and so, as they... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(755/1198) ...passed out, fell down upon a desk, and was as weak as any infant. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(756/1198) He was wrapped up to the chin, and busy with his horse and parcels, when she came into the room, prepared for going home. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(757/1198) 'Now, John, dear!  Good night, May!  Good night, Bertha!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(758/1198) Could she kiss them?  Could she be blithe and cheerful in her parting?  Could she venture to reveal her face to them without a blush?  Yes.  Tackleton observed her closely, and she did all this. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(759/1198) Tilly was hushing the Baby, and she crossed and re-crossed Tackleton, a dozen times, repeating drowsily: #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(760/1198) 'Did the knowledge that it was to be its wifes, then, wring its hearts almost to breaking; and did its fathers deceive it from its cradles but to break its hearts at last!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(761/1198) 'Now, Tilly, give me the Baby!  Good night, Mr. Tackleton.  Where's John, for goodness' sake?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(762/1198) 'He's going to walk beside the horse's head,' said Tackleton; who helped her to her seat. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(763/1198) 'My dear John.  Walk?  To-night?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(764/1198)  The muffled figure of her husband made a hasty sign in the affirmative; and the false stranger and the little nurse being in their places, the old horse moved off. Boxer, the unconscious Boxer, running on before,... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(765/1198) ...running back, running round and round the cart, and barking as triumphantly and merrily as ever. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(766/1198)  When Tackleton had gone off likewise, escorting May and her mother home, poor Caleb sat down by the fire beside his daughter; anxious and remorseful at the core; and still saying in his wistful contemplation of her,... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(767/1198) ...'Have I deceived her from her cradle, but to break her heart at last!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(768/1198)  The toys that had been set in motion for the Baby, had all stopped, and run down, long ago. In the faint light and silence, the imperturbably calm dolls, the agitated rocking-horses with distended eyes and nostrils, the... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(769/1198) ...old gentlemen at the street-doors, standing half doubled up upon their failing knees and ankles, the wry-faced nut-crackers, the very Beasts upon their way into the Ark, in twos, like a Boarding School out walking,... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(773/1198) ...plunged back into the Moorish Palace again, and clapped his little door behind him, as if the unwonted spectacle were too much for his feelings. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(774/1198) If the little Haymaker had been armed with the sharpest of scythes, and had cut at every stroke into the Carrier's heart, he never could have gashed and wounded it, as Dot had done. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(775/1198)  It was a heart so full of love for her; so bound up and held together by innumerable threads of winning remembrance, spun from the daily working of her many qualities of endearment; it was a heart in which she had... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(776/1198) ...enshrined herself so gently and so closely; a heart so single and so earnest in its Truth, so strong in right, so weak in wrong; that it could cherish neither passion nor revenge at first, and had only room to hold... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(778/1198)  But, slowly, slowly, as the Carrier sat brooding on his hearth, now cold and dark, other and fiercer thoughts began to rise within him, as an angry wind comes rising in the night. The Stranger was beneath his outraged... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(780/1198) ...hand to hand! He was the younger man. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(781/1198)  It was an ill-timed thought, bad for the dark mood of his mind. It was an angry thought, goading him to some avenging act, that should change the cheerful house into a haunted place which lonely travellers would dread... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(782/1198) ...to pass by night; and where the timid would see shadows struggling in the ruined windows when the moon was dim, and hear wild noises in the stormy weather. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(783/1198)  He was the younger man! Yes, yes; some lover who had won the heart that he had never touched. Some lover of her early choice, of whom she had thought and dreamed, for whom she had pined and pined, when he had fancied... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(784/1198) ...her so happy by his side. O agony to think of it! #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(785/1198)  She had been above-stairs with the Baby, getting it to bed. As he sat brooding on the hearth, she came close beside him, without his knowledge-in the turning of the rack of his great misery, he lost all other sounds-and... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(786/1198) ...put her little stool at his feet. He only knew it, when he felt her hand upon his own, and saw her looking up into his face. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(787/1198)  With wonder? No. It was his first impression, and he was fain to look at her again, to set it right. No, not with wonder. With an eager and inquiring look; but not with wonder. At first it was alarmed and serious; then,... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(788/1198) ...it changed into a strange, wild, dreadful smile of recognition of his thoughts; then, there was nothing but her clasped hands on her brow, and her bent head, and falling hair. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(789/1198)  Though the power of Omnipotence had been his to wield at that moment, he had too much of its diviner property of Mercy in his breast, to have turned one feather's weight of it against her. But he could not bear to see... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(790/1198) ...her crouching down upon the little seat where he had often looked on her, with love and pride, so innocent and gay; and, when she rose and left him, sobbing as she went, he felt it a relief to have the vacant place... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(791/1198) ...beside him rather than her so long-cherished presence. This in itself was anguish keener than all, reminding him how desolate he was become, and how the great bond of his life was rent asunder. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(792/1198)  The more he felt this, and the more he knew he could have better borne to see her lying prematurely dead before him with their little child upon her breast, the higher and the stronger rose his wrath against his enemy.... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(793/1198) ...He looked about him for a weapon. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(794/1198)  There was a gun, hanging on the wall. He took it down, and moved a pace or two towards the door of the perfidious Stranger's room. He knew the gun was loaded. Some shadowy idea that it was just to shoot this man like a... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(795/1198) ...wild beast, seized him, and dilated in his mind until it grew into a monstrous demon in complete possession of him, casting out all milder thoughts and setting up its undivided empire. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(797/1198) ...image, sorrowing, humbled, but still pleading to his tenderness and mercy with resistless power, never left his mind; but, staying there, it urged him to the door; raised the weapon to his shoulder; fitted and nerved... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(798/1198) ...his finger to the trigger; and cried 'Kill him! In his bed!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(799/1198) He reversed the gun to beat the stock upon the door; he already held it lifted in the air; some indistinct design was in his thoughts of calling out to him to fly, for God's sake, by the window- #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(800/1198) When, suddenly, the struggling fire illumined the whole chimney with a glow of light; and the Cricket on the Hearth began to Chirp! #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(801/1198)  No sound he could have heard, no human voice, not even hers, could so have moved and softened him. The artless words in which she had told him of her love for this same Cricket, were once more freshly spoken; her... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(802/1198) ...trembling, earnest manner at the moment, was again before him; her pleasant voice-O what a voice it was, for making household music at the fireside of an honest man!-thrilled through and through his better nature, and... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(803/1198) ...awoke it into life and action. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(804/1198)  He recoiled from the door, like a man walking in his sleep, awakened from a frightful dream; and put the gun aside. Clasping his hands before his face, he then sat down again beside the fire, and found relief in tears. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(805/1198) The Cricket on the Hearth came out into the room, and stood in Fairy shape before him. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(806/1198) '“I love it,”' said the Fairy Voice, repeating what he well remembered, '“for the many times I have heard it, and the many thoughts its harmless music has given me.”' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(807/1198) 'She said so!' cried the Carrier.  'True!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(808/1198) '“This has been a happy home, John; and I love the Cricket for its sake!”' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(809/1198) 'It has been, Heaven knows,' returned the Carrier.  'She made it happy, always,-until now.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(810/1198) 'So gracefully sweet-tempered; so domestic, joyful, busy, and light-hearted!' said the Voice. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(811/1198) 'Otherwise I never could have loved her as I did,' returned the Carrier. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(812/1198) The Voice, correcting him, said 'do.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(813/1198) The Carrier repeated 'as I did.'  But not firmly.  His faltering tongue resisted his control, and would speak in its own way, for itself and him. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(814/1198) The Figure, in an attitude of invocation, raised its hand and said: #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(815/1198) 'Upon your own hearth-' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(816/1198) 'The hearth she has blighted,' interposed the Carrier. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(817/1198)  'The hearth she has-how often!-blessed and brightened,' said the Cricket; 'the hearth which, but for her, were only a few stones and bricks and rusty bars, but which has been, through her, the Altar of your Home; on... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(821/1198) 'And pleads for her?' inquired the Carrier. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(822/1198) 'All things that speak the language of your hearth and home, must plead for her!' returned the Cricket.  'For they speak the truth.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(823/1198)  And while the Carrier, with his head upon his hands, continued to sit meditating in his chair, the Presence stood beside him, suggesting his reflections by its power, and presenting them before him, as in a glass or... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(829/1198) His thoughts were constant to her image.  It was always there. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(830/1198)  She sat plying her needle, before the fire, and singing to herself. Such a blithe, thriving, steady little Dot! The fairy figures turned upon him all at once, by one consent, with one prodigious concentrated stare, and... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(831/1198) ...seemed to say, 'Is this the light wife you are mourning for!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(832/1198)  There were sounds of gaiety outside, musical instruments, and noisy tongues, and laughter. A crowd of young merry-makers came pouring in, among whom were May Fielding and a score of pretty girls. Dot was the fairest of... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(833/1198) ...them all; as young as any of them too. They came to summon her to join their party. It was a dance. If ever little foot were made for dancing, hers was, surely. But she laughed, and shook her head, and pointed to her... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(837/1198) Again the staring figures turned upon him all at once, and seemed to say, 'Is this the wife who has forsaken you!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(838/1198)  A shadow fell upon the mirror or the picture: call it what you will. A great shadow of the Stranger, as he first stood underneath their roof; covering its surface, and blotting out all other objects. But the nimble... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(839/1198) ...Fairies worked like bees to clear it off again. And Dot again was there. Still bright and beautiful. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(840/1198) Rocking her little Baby in its cradle, singing to it softly, and resting her head upon a shoulder which had its counterpart in the musing figure by which the Fairy Cricket stood. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(841/1198)  The night-I mean the real night: not going by Fairy clocks-was wearing now; and in this stage of the Carrier's thoughts, the moon burst out, and shone brightly in the sky. Perhaps some calm and quiet light had risen... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(842/1198) ...also, in his mind; and he could think more soberly of what had happened. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(843/1198)  Although the shadow of the Stranger fell at intervals upon the glass-always distinct, and big, and thoroughly defined-it never fell so darkly as at first. Whenever it appeared, the Fairies uttered a general cry of... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(860/1198)  Thus the night passed. The moon went down; the stars grew pale; the cold day broke; the sun rose. The Carrier still sat, musing, in the chimney corner. He had sat there, with his head upon his hands, all night. All... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(865/1198) ...year! #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(866/1198)  The Carrier had expected that Tackleton would pay him an early visit; and he was right. He had not walked to and fro before his own door, many minutes, when he saw the Toy-merchant coming in his chaise along the road.... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(867/1198) ...As the chaise drew nearer, he perceived that Tackleton was dressed out sprucely for his marriage, and that he had decorated his horse's head with flowers and favours. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(868/1198) The horse looked much more like a bridegroom than Tackleton, whose half-closed eye was more disagreeably expressive than ever.  But the Carrier took little heed of this.  His thoughts had other occupation. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(869/1198) 'John Peerybingle!' said Tackleton, with an air of condolence.  'My good fellow, how do you find yourself this morning?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(870/1198)  'I have had but a poor night, Master Tackleton,' returned the Carrier, shaking his head: 'for I have been a good deal disturbed in my mind. But it's over now! Can you spare me half an hour or so, for some private talk?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(871/1198) 'I came on purpose,' returned Tackleton, alighting.  'Never mind the horse.  He'll stand quiet enough, with the reins over this post, if you'll give him a mouthful of hay.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(872/1198) The Carrier having brought it from his stable, and set it before him, they turned into the house. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(873/1198) 'You are not married before noon,' he said, 'I think?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(874/1198) 'No,' answered Tackleton.  'Plenty of time.  Plenty of time.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(875/1198)  When they entered the kitchen, Tilly Slowboy was rapping at the Stranger's door; which was only removed from it by a few steps. One of her very red eyes (for Tilly had been crying all night long, because her mistress... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(876/1198) ...cried) was at the keyhole; and she was knocking very loud; and seemed frightened. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(877/1198) 'If you please I can't make nobody hear,' said Tilly, looking round.  'I hope nobody an't gone and been and died if you please!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(878/1198) This philanthropic wish, Miss Slowboy emphasised with various new raps and kicks at the door; which led to no result whatever. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(879/1198) 'Shall I go?' said Tackleton.  'It's curious.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(880/1198) The Carrier, who had turned his face from the door, signed to him to go if he would. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(881/1198)  So Tackleton went to Tilly Slowboy's relief; and he too kicked and knocked; and he too failed to get the least reply. But he thought of trying the handle of the door; and as it opened easily, he peeped in, looked in,... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(882/1198) ...went in, and soon came running out again. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(883/1198) 'John Peerybingle,' said Tackleton, in his ear.  'I hope there has been nothing-nothing rash in the night?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(884/1198) The Carrier turned upon him quickly. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(885/1198) 'Because he's gone!' said Tackleton; 'and the window's open.  I don't see any marks-to be sure it's almost on a level with the garden: but I was afraid there might have been some-some scuffle.  Eh?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(886/1198) He nearly shut up the expressive eye altogether; he looked at him so hard.  And he gave his eye, and his face, and his whole person, a sharp twist.  As if he would have screwed the truth out of him. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(887/1198)  'Make yourself easy,' said the Carrier. 'He went into that room last night, without harm in word or deed from me, and no one has entered it since. He is away of his own free will. I'd go out gladly at that door, and beg... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(888/1198) ...my bread from house to house, for life, if I could so change the past that he had never come. But he has come and gone. And I have done with him!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(889/1198) 'Oh!-Well, I think he has got off pretty easy,' said Tackleton, taking a chair. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(890/1198) The sneer was lost upon the Carrier, who sat down too, and shaded his face with his hand, for some little time, before proceeding. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(891/1198) 'You showed me last night,' he said at length, 'my wife; my wife that I love; secretly-' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(892/1198) 'And tenderly,' insinuated Tackleton. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(893/1198)  'Conniving at that man's disguise, and giving him opportunities of meeting her alone. I think there's no sight I wouldn't have rather seen than that. I think there's no man in the world I wouldn't have rather had to... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(894/1198) ...show it me.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(895/1198) 'I confess to having had my suspicions always,' said Tackleton.  'And that has made me objectionable here, I know.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(896/1198)  'But as you did show it me,' pursued the Carrier, not minding him; 'and as you saw her, my wife, my wife that I love'-his voice, and eye, and hand, grew steadier and firmer as he repeated these words: evidently in... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(897/1198) ...pursuance of a steadfast purpose-'as you saw her at this disadvantage, it is right and just that you should also see with my eyes, and look into my breast, and know what my mind is, upon the subject. For it's... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(898/1198) ...settled,' said the Carrier, regarding him attentively. 'And nothing can shake it now.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(899/1198)  Tackleton muttered a few general words of assent, about its being necessary to vindicate something or other; but he was overawed by the manner of his companion. Plain and unpolished as it was, it had a something... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(900/1198) ...dignified and noble in it, which nothing but the soul of generous honour dwelling in the man could have imparted. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(901/1198)  'I am a plain, rough man,' pursued the Carrier, 'with very little to recommend me. I am not a clever man, as you very well know. I am not a young man. I loved my little Dot, because I had seen her grow up, from a child,... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(902/1198) ...in her father's house; because I knew how precious she was; because she had been my life, for years and years. There's many men I can't compare with, who never could have loved my little Dot like me, I think!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(903/1198) He paused, and softly beat the ground a short time with his foot, before resuming. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(904/1198)  'I often thought that though I wasn't good enough for her, I should make her a kind husband, and perhaps know her value better than another; and in this way I reconciled it to myself, and came to think it might be... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(905/1198) ...possible that we should be married. And in the end it came about, and we were married.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(906/1198) 'Hah!' said Tackleton, with a significant shake of the head. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(907/1198) 'I had studied myself; I had had experience of myself; I knew how much I loved her, and how happy I should be,' pursued the Carrier.  'But I had not-I feel it now-sufficiently considered her.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(908/1198) 'To be sure,' said Tackleton.  'Giddiness, frivolity, fickleness, love of admiration!  Not considered!  All left out of sight!  Hah!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(909/1198)  'You had best not interrupt me,' said the Carrier, with some sternness, 'till you understand me; and you're wide of doing so. If, yesterday, I'd have struck that man down at a blow, who dared to breathe a word against... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(910/1198) ...her, to-day I'd set my foot upon his face, if he was my brother!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(911/1198) The Toy-merchant gazed at him in astonishment.  He went on in a softer tone: #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(912/1198)  'Did I consider,' said the Carrier, 'that I took her-at her age, and with her beauty-from her young companions, and the many scenes of which she was the ornament; in which she was the brightest little star that ever... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(913/1198) ...shone, to shut her up from day to day in my dull house, and keep my tedious company? Did I consider how little suited I was to her sprightly humour, and how wearisome a plodding man like me must be, to one of her... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(914/1198) ...quick spirit? Did I consider that it was no merit in me, or claim in me, that I loved her, when everybody must, who knew her? Never. I took advantage of her hopeful nature and her cheerful disposition; and I married... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(915/1198) ...her. I wish I never had! For her sake; not for mine!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(916/1198) The Toy-merchant gazed at him, without winking.  Even the half-shut eye was open now. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(917/1198)  'Heaven bless her!' said the Carrier, 'for the cheerful constancy with which she tried to keep the knowledge of this from me! And Heaven help me, that, in my slow mind, I have not found it out before! Poor child! Poor... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(918/1198) ...Dot! I not to find it out, who have seen her eyes fill with tears, when such a marriage as our own was spoken of! I, who have seen the secret trembling on her lips a hundred times, and never suspected it till last... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(919/1198) ...night! Poor girl! That I could ever hope she would be fond of me! That I could ever believe she was!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(920/1198) 'She made a show of it,' said Tackleton.  'She made such a show of it, that to tell you the truth it was the origin of my misgivings.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(921/1198) And here he asserted the superiority of May Fielding, who certainly made no sort of show of being fond of him. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(922/1198)  'She has tried,' said the poor Carrier, with greater emotion than he had exhibited yet; 'I only now begin to know how hard she has tried, to be my dutiful and zealous wife. How good she has been; how much she has done;... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(923/1198) ...how brave and strong a heart she has; let the happiness I have known under this roof bear witness! It will be some help and comfort to me, when I am here alone.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(924/1198) 'Here alone?' said Tackleton.  'Oh!  Then you do mean to take some notice of this?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(925/1198)  'I mean,' returned the Carrier, 'to do her the greatest kindness, and make her the best reparation, in my power. I can release her from the daily pain of an unequal marriage, and the struggle to conceal it. She shall be... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(926/1198) ...as free as I can render her.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(927/1198) 'Make her reparation!' exclaimed Tackleton, twisting and turning his great ears with his hands.  'There must be something wrong here.  You didn't say that, of course.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(928/1198) The Carrier set his grip upon the collar of the Toy-merchant, and shook him like a reed. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(929/1198) 'Listen to me!' he said.  'And take care that you hear me right.  Listen to me.  Do I speak plainly?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(930/1198) 'Very plainly indeed,' answered Tackleton. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(931/1198) 'As if I meant it?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(932/1198) 'Very much as if you meant it.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(933/1198)  'I sat upon that hearth, last night, all night,' exclaimed the Carrier. 'On the spot where she has often sat beside me, with her sweet face looking into mine. I called up her whole life, day by day. I had her dear self,... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(934/1198) ...in its every passage, in review before me. And upon my soul she is innocent, if there is One to judge the innocent and guilty!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(935/1198) Staunch Cricket on the Hearth!  Loyal household Fairies! #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(936/1198)  'Passion and distrust have left me!' said the Carrier; 'and nothing but my grief remains. In an unhappy moment some old lover, better suited to her tastes and years than I; forsaken, perhaps, for me, against her will;... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(937/1198) ...returned. In an unhappy moment, taken by surprise, and wanting time to think of what she did, she made herself a party to his treachery, by concealing it. Last night she saw him, in the interview we witnessed. It was... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(938/1198) ...wrong. But otherwise than this she is innocent if there is truth on earth!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(939/1198) 'If that is your opinion'-Tackleton began. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(940/1198)  'So, let her go!' pursued the Carrier. 'Go, with my blessing for the many happy hours she has given me, and my forgiveness for any pang she has caused me. Let her go, and have the peace of mind I wish her! She'll never... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(941/1198) ...hate me. She'll learn to like me better, when I'm not a drag upon her, and she wears the chain I have riveted, more lightly. This is the day on which I took her, with so little thought for her enjoyment, from her... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(943/1198) ...anywhere. She leaves me without blame, and she will live so I am sure. If I should die-I may perhaps while she is still young; I have lost some courage in a few hours-she'll find that I remembered her, and loved her... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(945/1198)  'O no, John, not over. Do not say it's over yet! Not quite yet. I have heard your noble words. I could not steal away, pretending to be ignorant of what has affected me with such deep gratitude. Do not say it's over,... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(946/1198) ...'till the clock has struck again!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(947/1198)  She had entered shortly after Tackleton, and had remained there. She never looked at Tackleton, but fixed her eyes upon her husband. But she kept away from him, setting as wide a space as possible between them; and... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(948/1198) ...though she spoke with most impassioned earnestness, she went no nearer to him even then. How different in this from her old self! #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(949/1198)  'No hand can make the clock which will strike again for me the hours that are gone,' replied the Carrier, with a faint smile. 'But let it be so, if you will, my dear. It will strike soon. It's of little matter what we... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(950/1198) ...say. I'd try to please you in a harder case than that.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(951/1198)  'Well!' muttered Tackleton. 'I must be off, for when the clock strikes again, it'll be necessary for me to be upon my way to church. Good morning, John Peerybingle. I'm sorry to be deprived of the pleasure of your... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(952/1198) ...company. Sorry for the loss, and the occasion of it too!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(953/1198) 'I have spoken plainly?' said the Carrier, accompanying him to the door. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(954/1198) 'Oh quite!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(955/1198) 'And you'll remember what I have said?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(956/1198) 'Why, if you compel me to make the observation,' said Tackleton, previously taking the precaution of getting into his chaise; 'I must say that it was so very unexpected, that I'm far from being likely to forget it.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(957/1198) 'The better for us both,' returned the Carrier.  'Good bye.  I give you joy!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(958/1198)  'I wish I could give it to you,' said Tackleton. 'As I can't; thank'ee. Between ourselves, (as I told you before, eh?) I don't much think I shall have the less joy in my married life, because May hasn't been too... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(959/1198) ...officious about me, and too demonstrative. Good bye! Take care of yourself.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(960/1198)  The Carrier stood looking after him until he was smaller in the distance than his horse's flowers and favours near at hand; and then, with a deep sigh, went strolling like a restless, broken man, among some neighbouring... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(961/1198) ...elms; unwilling to return until the clock was on the eve of striking. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(962/1198)  His little wife, being left alone, sobbed piteously; but often dried her eyes and checked herself, to say how good he was, how excellent he was! and once or twice she laughed; so heartily, triumphantly, and incoherently... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(963/1198) ...(still crying all the time), that Tilly was quite horrified. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(964/1198) 'Ow if you please don't!' said Tilly.  'It's enough to dead and bury the Baby, so it is if you please.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(965/1198) 'Will you bring him sometimes, to see his father, Tilly,' inquired her mistress, drying her eyes; 'when I can't live here, and have gone to my old home?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(966/1198)  'Ow if you please don't!' cried Tilly, throwing back her head, and bursting out into a howl-she looked at the moment uncommonly like Boxer. 'Ow if you please don't! Ow, what has everybody gone and been and done with... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(967/1198) ...everybody, making everybody else so wretched! Ow-w-w-w!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(968/1198)  The soft-hearted Slowboy trailed off at this juncture, into such a deplorable howl, the more tremendous from its long suppression, that she must infallibly have awakened the Baby, and frightened him into something... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(972/1198) 'Mary!' said Bertha.  'Not at the marriage!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(973/1198)  'I told her you would not be there, mum,' whispered Caleb. 'I heard as much last night. But bless you,' said the little man, taking her tenderly by both hands, 'I don't care for what they say. I don't believe them.... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(974/1198) ...There an't much of me, but that little should be torn to pieces sooner than I'd trust a word against you!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(975/1198) He put his arms about her and hugged her, as a child might have hugged one of his own dolls. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(976/1198)  'Bertha couldn't stay at home this morning,' said Caleb. 'She was afraid, I know, to hear the bells ring, and couldn't trust herself to be so near them on their wedding-day. So we started in good time, and came here. I... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(980/1198)  'Mary,' said Bertha, 'where is your hand! Ah! Here it is here it is!' pressing it to her lips, with a smile, and drawing it through her arm. 'I heard them speaking softly among themselves, last night, of some blame... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(981/1198) ...against you. They were wrong.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(982/1198) The Carrier's Wife was silent.  Caleb answered for her. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(983/1198) 'They were wrong,' he said. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(984/1198) 'I knew it!' cried Bertha, proudly.  'I told them so.  I scorned to hear a word!  Blame her with justice!' she pressed the hand between her own, and the soft cheek against her face.  'No!  I am not so blind as that.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(985/1198) Her father went on one side of her, while Dot remained upon the other: holding her hand. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(986/1198)  'I know you all,' said Bertha, 'better than you think. But none so well as her. Not even you, father. There is nothing half so real and so true about me, as she is. If I could be restored to sight this instant, and not... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(987/1198) ...a word were spoken, I could choose her from a crowd! My sister!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(988/1198) 'Bertha, my dear!' said Caleb, 'I have something on my mind I want to tell you, while we three are alone.  Hear me kindly!  I have a confession to make to you, my darling.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(989/1198) 'A confession, father?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(990/1198) 'I have wandered from the truth and lost myself, my child,' said Caleb, with a pitiable expression in his bewildered face.  'I have wandered from the truth, intending to be kind to you; and have been cruel.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(991/1198) She turned her wonder-stricken face towards him, and repeated 'Cruel!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(992/1198) 'He accuses himself too strongly, Bertha,' said Dot.  'You'll say so, presently.  You'll be the first to tell him so.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(993/1198) 'He cruel to me!' cried Bertha, with a smile of incredulity. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(994/1198)  'Not meaning it, my child,' said Caleb. 'But I have been; though I never suspected it, till yesterday. My dear blind daughter, hear me and forgive me! The world you live in, heart of mine, doesn't exist as I have... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(995/1198) ...represented it. The eyes you have trusted in, have been false to you.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(996/1198) She turned her wonder-stricken face towards him still; but drew back, and clung closer to her friend. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(997/1198)  'Your road in life was rough, my poor one,' said Caleb, 'and I meant to smooth it for you. I have altered objects, changed the characters of people, invented many things that never have been, to make you happier. I have... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(998/1198) ...had concealments from you, put deceptions on you, God forgive me! and surrounded you with fancies.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(999/1198) 'But living people are not fancies!' she said hurriedly, and turning very pale, and still retiring from him.  'You can't change them.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1000/1198) 'I have done so, Bertha,' pleaded Caleb.  'There is one person that you know, my dove-' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1001/1198) 'Oh father! why do you say, I know?' she answered, in a term of keen reproach.  'What and whom do I know!  I who have no leader!  I so miserably blind.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1002/1198) In the anguish of her heart, she stretched out her hands, as if she were groping her way; then spread them, in a manner most forlorn and sad, upon her face. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1003/1198)  'The marriage that takes place to-day,' said Caleb, 'is with a stern, sordid, grinding man. A hard master to you and me, my dear, for many years. Ugly in his looks, and in his nature. Cold and callous always. Unlike... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1004/1198) ...what I have painted him to you in everything, my child. In everything.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1005/1198)  'Oh why,' cried the Blind Girl, tortured, as it seemed, almost beyond endurance, 'why did you ever do this! Why did you ever fill my heart so full, and then come in like Death, and tear away the objects of my love! O... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1006/1198) ...Heaven, how blind I am! How helpless and alone!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1007/1198) Her afflicted father hung his head, and offered no reply but in his penitence and sorrow. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1008/1198)  She had been but a short time in this passion of regret, when the Cricket on the Hearth, unheard by all but her, began to chirp. Not merrily, but in a low, faint, sorrowing way. It was so mournful that her tears began... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1009/1198) ...to flow; and when the Presence which had been beside the Carrier all night, appeared behind her, pointing to her father, they fell down like rain. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1010/1198) She heard the Cricket-voice more plainly soon, and was conscious, through her blindness, of the Presence hovering about her father. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1011/1198) 'Mary,' said the Blind Girl, 'tell me what my home is.  What it truly is.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1012/1198)  'It is a poor place, Bertha; very poor and bare indeed. The house will scarcely keep out wind and rain another winter. It is as roughly shielded from the weather, Bertha,' Dot continued in a low, clear voice, 'as your... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1013/1198) ...poor father in his sack-cloth coat.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1014/1198) The Blind Girl, greatly agitated, rose, and led the Carrier's little wife aside. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1015/1198) 'Those presents that I took such care of; that came almost at my wish, and were so dearly welcome to me,' she said, trembling; 'where did they come from?  Did you send them?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1016/1198) 'No.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1017/1198) 'Who then?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1018/1198) Dot saw she knew, already, and was silent.  The Blind Girl spread her hands before her face again.  But in quite another manner now. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1019/1198) 'Dear Mary, a moment.  One moment?  More this way.  Speak softly to me.  You are true, I know.  You'd not deceive me now; would you?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1020/1198) 'No, Bertha, indeed!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1021/1198) 'No, I am sure you would not.  You have too much pity for me.  Mary, look across the room to where we were just now-to where my father is-my father, so compassionate and loving to me-and tell me what you see.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1022/1198) 'I see,' said Dot, who understood her well, 'an old man sitting in a chair, and leaning sorrowfully on the back, with his face resting on his hand.  As if his child should comfort him, Bertha.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1023/1198) 'Yes, yes.  She will.  Go on.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1024/1198)  'He is an old man, worn with care and work. He is a spare, dejected, thoughtful, grey-haired man. I see him now, despondent and bowed down, and striving against nothing. But, Bertha, I have seen him many times before,... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1025/1198) ...and striving hard in many ways for one great sacred object. And I honour his grey head, and bless him!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1026/1198) The Blind Girl broke away from her; and throwing herself upon her knees before him, took the grey head to her breast. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1027/1198) 'It is my sight restored.  It is my sight!' she cried.  'I have been blind, and now my eyes are open.  I never knew him!  To think I might have died, and never truly seen the father who has been so loving to me!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1028/1198) There were no words for Caleb's emotion. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1029/1198)  'There is not a gallant figure on this earth,' exclaimed the Blind Girl, holding him in her embrace, 'that I would love so dearly, and would cherish so devotedly, as this! The greyer, and more worn, the dearer, father!... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1030/1198) ...Never let them say I am blind again. There's not a furrow in his face, there's not a hair upon his head, that shall be forgotten in my prayers and thanks to Heaven!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1031/1198) Caleb managed to articulate 'My Bertha!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(1034/1198)  'Nothing is gone,' she answered. 'Dearest father, no! Everything is here-in you. The father that I loved so well; the father that I never loved enough, and never knew; the benefactor whom I first began to reverence and... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(1041/1198) 'There is no change in her.  You never told me anything of her that was not true?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1042/1198)  'I should have done it, my dear, I am afraid,' returned Caleb, 'if I could have made her better than she was. But I must have changed her for the worse, if I had changed her at all. Nothing could improve her, Bertha.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1043/1198) Confident as the Blind Girl had been when she asked the question, her delight and pride in the reply and her renewed embrace of Dot, were charming to behold. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1044/1198)  'More changes than you think for, may happen though, my dear,' said Dot. 'Changes for the better, I mean; changes for great joy to some of us. You mustn't let them startle you too much, if any such should ever happen,... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(1047/1198)  'I-I-I know you have a quick ear,' said Dot, placing her hand upon her heart, and evidently talking on, as fast as she could to hide its palpitating state, 'because I have noticed it often, and because you were so quick... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(1050/1198)  Caleb wondered what this meant; perceiving that she spoke to him, no less than to his daughter. He saw her, with astonishment, so fluttered and distressed that she could scarcely breathe; and holding to a chair, to save... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1051/1198) ...herself from falling. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1052/1198) 'They are wheels indeed!' she panted.  'Coming nearer!  Nearer!  Very close!  And now you hear them stopping at the garden-gate!  And now you hear a step outside the door-the same step, Bertha, is it not!-and now!'- #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1053/1198) She uttered a wild cry of uncontrollable delight; and running up to Caleb put her hands upon his eyes, as a young man rushed into the room, and flinging away his hat into the air, came sweeping down upon them. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1054/1198) 'Is it over?' cried Dot. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1055/1198) 'Yes!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(1059/1198) 'If my boy in the Golden South Americas was alive'-said Caleb, trembling. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1060/1198)  'He is alive!' shrieked Dot, removing her hands from his eyes, and clapping them in ecstasy; 'look at him! See where he stands before you, healthy and strong! Your own dear son! Your own dear living, loving brother,... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(1065/1198) The Carrier, entering, started back.  And well he might, to find himself in such good company. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1066/1198) 'Look, John!' said Caleb, exultingly, 'look here!  My own boy from the Golden South Americas!  My own son!  Him that you fitted out, and sent away yourself!  Him that you were always such a friend to!' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1067/1198) The Carrier advanced to seize him by the hand; but, recoiling, as some feature in his face awakened a remembrance of the Deaf Man in the Cart, said: #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1068/1198) 'Edward!  Was it you?' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1069/1198) 'Now tell him all!' cried Dot.  'Tell him all, Edward; and don't spare me, for nothing shall make me spare myself in his eyes, ever again.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1070/1198) 'I was the man,' said Edward. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1071/1198)  'And could you steal, disguised, into the house of your old friend?' rejoined the Carrier. 'There was a frank boy once-how many years is it, Caleb, since we heard that he was dead, and had it proved, we thought?-who... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(1073/1198) 'There was a generous friend of mine, once; more a father to me than a friend;' said Edward, 'who never would have judged me, or any other man, unheard.  You were he.  So I am certain you will hear me now.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1074/1198) The Carrier, with a troubled glance at Dot, who still kept far away from him, replied, 'Well! that's but fair.  I will.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1075/1198)  'You must know that when I left here, a boy,' said Edward, 'I was in love, and my love was returned. She was a very young girl, who perhaps (you may tell me) didn't know her own mind. But I knew mine, and I had a... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(1094/1198) Amid the tumult of emotions in his breast, the honest Carrier had stood, confounded.  Flying, now, towards her, Dot stretched out her hand to stop him, and retreated as before. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1095/1198)  'No, John, no! Hear all! Don't love me any more, John, till you've heard every word I have to say. It was wrong to have a secret from you, John. I'm very sorry. I didn't think it any harm, till I came and sat down by... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(1118/1198)  'Why, what the Devil's this, John Peerybingle!' said Tackleton. 'There's some mistake. I appointed Mrs. Tackleton to meet me at the church, and I'll swear I passed her on the road, on her way here. Oh! here she is! I... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(1122/1198) 'I mean, that as I can make allowance for your being vexed,' returned the other, with a smile, 'I am as deaf to harsh discourse this morning, as I was to all discourse last night.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1123/1198) The look that Tackleton bestowed upon him, and the start he gave! #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1124/1198)  'I am sorry, sir,' said Edward, holding out May's left hand, and especially the third finger; 'that the young lady can't accompany you to church; but as she has been there once, this morning, perhaps you'll excuse her.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1125/1198) Tackleton looked hard at the third finger, and took a little piece of silver-paper, apparently containing a ring, from his waistcoat-pocket. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1126/1198) 'Miss Slowboy,' said Tackleton.  'Will you have the kindness to throw that in the fire?  Thank'ee.' #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1127/1198) 'It was a previous engagement, quite an old engagement, that prevented my wife from keeping her appointment with you, I assure you,' said Edward. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1128/1198) 'Mr. Tackleton will do me the justice to acknowledge that I revealed it to him faithfully; and that I told him, many times, I never could forget it,' said May, blushing. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(1176/1198) ...and your daughter to me, and what a miserable idiot I was, when I took her for one! Friends, one and all, my house is very lonely to-night. I have not so much as a Cricket on my Hearth. I have scared them all away. Be... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(1178/1198)  He was at home in five minutes. You never saw such a fellow. What had he been doing with himself all his life, never to have known, before, his great capacity of being jovial! Or what had the Fairies been doing with... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(1180/1198) 'John! you won't send me home this evening; will you?' whispered Dot. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1181/1198) He had been very near it though! #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(1186/1198)  There was a dance in the evening. With which general mention of that recreation, I should have left it alone, if I had not some reason to suppose that it was quite an original dance, and one of a most uncommon figure.... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1187/1198) ...It was formed in an odd way; in this way. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
(1188/1198)  Edward, that sailor-fellow-a good free dashing sort of a fellow he was-had been telling them various marvels concerning parrots, and mines, and Mexicans, and gold dust, when all at once he took it in his head to jump up... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(1191/1198) So, May and Edward got up, amid great applause, to dance alone; and Bertha plays her liveliest tune. #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted

(1197/1198)  But what is this! Even as I listen to them, blithely, and turn towards Dot, for one last glimpse of a little figure very pleasant to me, she and the rest have vanished into air, and I am left alone. A Cricket sings upon... #cricketOnTheHearthTweeted
